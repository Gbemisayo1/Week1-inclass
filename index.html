           <p>
            One thing a machine can not do is feel. They do not have emotions which I believe is core to dreaming about something machines can't dream. 
            Machines get data from datasets (a wide database). They often recycle thoughts are mix and match but can't do more than that. I will dream by feeling.
            I will let love, uncertainty and fear shape my imaginations in a way the machine can't. My dreams will be born from lived experiences and not logic.

            I believe that memories may fade or change but values and emotional impact remains. I want my dreams of the fun times, connections and kindness to be remebered
            in their raw forms and not as perfect stories but as moments that made others feel seen. What remains 
            is the hope that I made something worth remembering.
